# Task Completion Guidelines
- After changes, run relevant tests (`xcodebuild test` for iOS, `npm test` for server).
- Summarize key changes, note testing performed, and mention any configuration steps in PR description.
- For releases touching URLs or secrets, document `.env` / `wrangler.toml` setup for reviewers.
- Capture screenshots when UI changes occur.
